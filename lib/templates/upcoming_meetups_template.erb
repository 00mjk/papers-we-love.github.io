We have another great line-up of meet-ups scheduled for <%= @month %> across a number of our chapters:
<% @events.each do |event| %><% e = process_fields(event) %>
**<%= e[:city] %> <%= e[:formatted_time] %>**: [<%= e[:event_title] %>](<%= e[:url] %>)
<% end %> READMORE

The **New York Chapter** would like to give special thanks to our Platinum sponsor [TwoSigma](https://www.twosigma.com). We would like to give additional thanks to [The Ladders](http://dev.theladders.com) and [Tumblr](http://engineering.tumblr.com) and for providing food/refreshments and facilities for the <%= @month %> meetup.
