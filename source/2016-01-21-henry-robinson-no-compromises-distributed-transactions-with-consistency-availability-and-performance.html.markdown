**Bios**

**Henry** is an engineer at Cloudera, where he has worked for five years on a wide variety of distributed systems. He currently works full-time on Impala, a SQL query engine for data stored in HDFS. Before Cloudera, he worked on ad-hoc networking at Cambridge University. He writes infrequently about databases and distributed systems at [http://the-paper-trail.org/](http://the-paper-trail.org/)

**Bryan** hacks distributed systems by day, and does almost anything else by night. His interests in percussion and computers began nearly coincidentally over twenty years ago in a small town on the Great Plains. The combination has led to him having strange thoughts about time and coordination.
