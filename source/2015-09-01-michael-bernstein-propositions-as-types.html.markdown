_Michael was the very first speaker for Papers We Love, back  in February of 2014 in New York City [[Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtUtfARSIv8). His energy and obvious love for learning provided us with a template for the PWL organization as whole. -- Thanks, Papers We Love._

**Description**

Michael Bernstein talks about Philip Wadler’s paper **Propositions as Types**, which starts out with the following sentence: _"Powerful insights arise from linking two fields of study previously thought separate."_

And just keeps on going from there. In less than 9 full pages, Wadler assembles an exuberant, hilarious take on the deep, meaningful connections between mathematics, philosophy, and computer science.

He’ll also be showing off some work from Daniel P. Friedman and Carl Eastlund’s recent book [The Little Prover](http://www.amazon.com/The-Little-Prover-Daniel-Friedman/dp/0262527952), which implements a small theorem prover in Scheme, to demonstrate some of the connections Wadler discusses in his paper.

**Bio**

Michael R. Bernstein [@mrb_bk](https://twiiter.com/mrb_bk) loves you. He lives in Takoma Park, MD and spends most of his time thinking about pottery, obscure LPs, food, and the intersection of philosophy and Computer Science.
