**Gareth Morgan** on The Rendering Equation. From Gareth: "This paper is one of the most important 3D graphics papers in the subject's history.  The rendering equation put forth by James Kajiya is the foundation of many of the rendering techniques used in modern graphics. Anytime a computer generates physically accurate image it is actually attempting to solve the rendering equation"

Gareth Morgan has been involved in games and 3D graphics since 1999, starting at Silicon Graphics followed by several games companies including Activision and BAM Studios. Since 2008 he has been working at Imagination Technologies researching sophisticated rendering techniques using Imagination's ray tracing technology.
