# Vienna Chapter

In the spirit of the "Papers We Love" groups around the globe we are running our own version in Vienna:
Within the realm of computing, which is your favorite paper, the one that inspired or taught you the most, and which you want to tell the rest of the group about?
Present the paper, show how you've implemented and used it, or simply discuss!

The **Vienna Chapter** meets monthly at [StockWerk](https://www.google.com/maps/place/STOCKWERK+Coworking+GmbH/@48.192049,16.33598,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x550d7cd4afd7e9be) - Pater-Schwartz-Gasse 11A, 1150 Wien, Austria.

Papers We Love has a **[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**. Please contact one of the Meetup's organizers if anyone is not following it. Be good to each other and to the PWL community!

## Chapter Meetups

### Being Classless
<span class="meta">
Speaker: [Peter Brachwitz](https://twitter.com/p_brc/)
Date: [January 28, 2015](http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Vienna/events/219084988/)
Links: [Organizing Programs Without Classes](http://cs.au.dk/~hosc/local/LaSC-4-3-pp223-242.pdf)
</span>

Since we had a tie when we voted on interesting papers, we are covering the second winner this time. Peter will guide us through the discussion - again remember: This is not a presentation, but an interactive discussion. So please read the paper!

### First (Paper) Love
<span class="meta">
Speaker: [Dominik Gruber](https://twitter.com/the_dom)
Date: [December 10, 2014](http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Vienna/events/218624428/)
Links: [Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/de//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf)
</span>

After voting on the most interesting paper, we concluded that we'd kick off with Google's Bigtable. Dominik leads the discussion, but please remember: This is not a presentation, but an interactive discussion. Everyone should read the paper in advance and ideally have an opinion on it or its use. We meet in the kitchen to have the right setting :-)
