# Berlin Chapter

What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research publication with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, learn, and discuss.

We'll be using [papers-we-love's curated repository](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love). Please contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories.

PWL Berlin strictly adheres to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) set forth by all PWL charters.

### Soft Typing

Date: [December 9, 2014](http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Berlin/events/218874529/)

For the very first Papers We Love Berlin Meetup, we will have Erik Michaels-Ober from SoundCloud presenting the paper Soft Typing by Robert Cartwright and Mike Fagan.

This is particularly interesting for Rubyists, because Ruby 3.0 might ship with such a type system.

> This paper presents a soft type systems that retains the expressiveness of dynamic typing, but offers the early error detection and improved optimization capabilities of static typing. The key idea underlying soft typing is that a type checker need not reject programs containing "ill-typed" phrases. Instead, the type checker can insert explicit run-time checks, transforming "ill-typed" programs into type-correct ones.

Thanks to [ResearchGate](http://www.researchgate.net/) for hosting this first edition!
