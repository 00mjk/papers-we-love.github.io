**Description**

This paper is seminal in graph theory. It describes the maximum matchings blossom algorithm, which finds a decomposition of a graph in the maximum number of pairs connected by an edge.

It is also the base of the famous minimum weight maximum matchings algorithm, a very important algorithm used in many applications, from pairing in chess tournaments to resources or worker placement within companies.
