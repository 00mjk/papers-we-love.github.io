## San Francisco - March 17, 2016

* **Meetup:** [http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-too/events/228340935/](http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-too/events/228340935/)

### Caitie McCaffrey on [Sagas](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/cs711/2002fa/reading/sagas.pdf)

Long lived transactions (LLTs) hold on to
database resources for relatively long periods of
time, slgmficantly delaymg the termmatlon of
shorter and more common transactions To
alleviate these problems we propose the notion of
a saga A LLT 1s a saga if it can be written as a
sequence of transactions that can be interleaved
with other transactions The database management
system guarantees that either all the transactions
m a saga are successfully completed or
compensatmg transactions are run to amend a
partial execution Both the concept of saga and
its lmplementatlon are relatively simple, but they
have the potential to improve performance
slgmficantly We analyze the various lmplementatron
issues related to sagas, including how they
can be run on an exlstmg system that does not
directly support them We also discuss techniques
for database and LLT design that make it
feasible to break up LLTs mto sagas

### Gilbert Bernstein on [Marching Cubes](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/meshpapers/LorensenCline.pdf)

Marching Cubes is one of the most important geometry algorithms for 3D volume visualization, 3D scanning/reconstruction, etc. It has the distinction of being the most cited graphics paper ever. And it's also definitely not the best algorithm you could implement for the problem it solves. Intriguing?

**Bio**

[Gilbert Bernstein](http://www.gilbertbernstein.com/) is a Ph.D. student in the department of Computer Science at Stanford University.  His work focuses on a range of topics across Computer Graphics, HCI and Programming Languages, including Domain-Specific (Programming) Languages, Visual Tools for Artists and Designers, Geometry and Topology.  He’s gotten some awards in the past that you don’t really care about.  The only song Gilbert can rap at karaoke is “Amish Paradise."
