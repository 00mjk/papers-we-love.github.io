**Ben Darwin** on Programming with Algebraic Effects and Handlers

* **Meetup:** [http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Toronto/events/224152792/](http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Toronto/events/224152792/)
* **Paper:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1539v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1539v1)

**Description**

Handlers for algebraic effects are a promising development in managing complexity in software.  In addition to the prototypal implementation in Eff (http://www.eff-lang.org/), they've also been implemented variously as a Haskell library, in the experimental functional languages Idris, Koka, and F-star, and in an experimental branch of the Ocaml compiler (https://github.com/ocamllabs/opam-repo-dev).  I'll begin by looking for some intuitive motivation for the concept as a generalization of familiar ideas like exceptions.  After looking at the syntax and semantics of the new constructs, we'll  consider a number of examples (in Eff and/or Ocaml) from the paper including implementing probabilistic programming and thread scheduling.  I'll briefly compare such effect systems against Haskell's monad transformers without getting into details of the latter

**Bio**

Ben Darwin is a programmer at Sick Kids Hospital's Mouse Imaging Centre.
