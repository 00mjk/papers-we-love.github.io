**Peter Sobot** on An Industrial-Strength Audio Search Algorithm

* **Meetup:** [http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Toronto/events/224721193/](http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Toronto/events/224721193/)
* **Paper:** [https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf)

**Description**

This paper introduces the Shazam algorithm, the core algorithm behind the popular Shazam music and audio identification service. We'll discuss what problems the algorithm solves and how it works quickly and effectively. This talk is fairly high-level, and is aimed at anybody interested in learning how Shazam works, but will be of special interest to those interested in large-scale information retrieval, audio processing or perceptual hashing.

**Bio**

[Peter Sobot](http://petersobot.com/) is a software engineer at PagerDuty, where he helps add new functionality to their high-availability alerting platform.
