**Donny Nadolny** on Raft

* **Meetup:** [http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Toronto/events/222561882/](http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Toronto/events/222561882/)
* **Paper:** [https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/raft.pdf](https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/raft.pdf)

**Description**

This paper introduces the Raft consensus algorithm, which is an attempt to make a consensus algorithm that is easy to understand and easy to implement. 

We'll discuss what consensus is, why it's useful, and what it's used for. You'll also learn the main components of Raft: leader election, data replication, and the rules for recovering from failure / ensuring safety.
