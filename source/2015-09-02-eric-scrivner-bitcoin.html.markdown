**Eric Scrivner** on Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

* **Meetup:** [http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-LA/events/224423506/](http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-LA/events/224423506/)
* **Paper:** [https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

**Description**

Bitcoin is many things - a critique, a currency, a protocol, and perhaps even acontemporary industrial revolution. More immediately, however, bitcoin and theoriginal paper that spawned it are of interest to the working programmer as astudy in the design of fault-tolerant, decentralized systems. Beginning fromthe crtique of trusted third parties we will see how bitcoin provides novelstarting points for system architecture in the age of increasingly cheap andubiquitous computing power, as well as speculate about what all this mightentail for the future.
