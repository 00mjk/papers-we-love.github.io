      to the classic linked list that retains its persistence and easy extensibility
      while adding in the fast random access indexing typical of arrays. </p> <p>We''ll
      explore this data structure from a variety of perspectives, and look at several
      modifications that extend its power: the VArray, a resizable array variant;
      a catenable deque using the VDList and VCat; and an average constant time hash-list.</p>
      <p>We''ll also look at the impacts of this data structure on thread safety,
      garbage collection, Lisps (via Visp, a Lisp using the VList as its basic data
      structure), and multi-dimensional data structures. </p> <p>Doors open at 6:30

      <p><a href="http://twitter.com/chris_saunders">Chris Saunders</a> will be presenting the paper <a href="http://jeapostrophe.github.io/home/static/cooper-sigcse2013.pdf">Teaching Garbage Collection without Implementing Compilers and Interpreters</a> by G. Coopher, A. Guha, S. Krishnamurthi, J. McCarthy and R. Findler.</p> <p>

      ***</p> <p>

      The paper covers the issues with teaching Garbage Collection in an academic setting and the pitfalls around existing solutions. In an effort to remove obstacles that prevented students from implementing they have built a system that aids in the implementation of Garbage Collectors.</p> <p>

      Along with presenting the paper, Chris will explain garbage collection, collector techniques as well as the collector and mutator "languages" built by the authors. The system is <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/plai/collector.html">publicly available</a> and you can see a number of <a href="https://github.com/plt/racket/blob/84de4fd8e3a60254a7653fa90c80e9c4ec2bdca8/pkgs/plai/tests/gc/good-collectors/good-collector.rkt">collector implementations</a> that you can use to experiment within Dr. Racket.</p> <p>

      <b>Doors open at 6:30 pm, presentation will begin at 7:00 pm.</b> There will be food and refreshments provided by Shopify.</p> <p>

After a brief discussion of the role of higher-order functions in quantum information theory, we define the quantum lambda calculus and its operational semantics. Safety invariants, such as the no-cloning property, are enforced by a static type system that is based on intuitionistic linear logic. We will also describe a type inference algorithm, and a categorical semantics.</p> <p><br/><b>Doors open at 6:30 pm, presentation will begin at 7:00 pm.</b> There will be food and refreshments provided by Shopify.</p> <p><br/>***</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/thephoeron">Colin</a> is the CTO and Lead Dev of Catapult Labs (<a href="http://catapult-app.com/"><a href="http://catapult-app.com" class="linkified">http://catapult-app.com</a></a>) and lead author of Learn Lisp The Hard Way (<a href="http://learnlispthehardway.org/"><a href="http://learnlispthehardway.org/" class="linkified">http://learnlispthehardway.org/</a></a>).

    <p><b>We meet the first Wednesday of every month around 6:30pm, unless otherwise specified!</b></p>
    <p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss. This is a Toronto chapter of the original Papers We Love group in NYC: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/" class="linkified">http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/</a></p>
    <p>We're curating a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">repository</a>&nbsp;for papers and places-to-find papers.&nbsp;You can contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories.</p>
    <p>If you need to reach out to us or have ideas for papers, just ask us via our&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/PapersWeLoveTO">twitter account</a>.</p>
    <p>Papers We Love has a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>. Please contact one of the Meetup's organizers if anyone is not following it. Be good to each other and to the PWL community! <br> </p>

      <p><b>Equal Rights for Functional Objects, or, The More Things Change, the More they Stay the Same</b></p> <p>There are many ways of defining equality, particularly in a language which has both object-oriented and functional aspects. There's reference equality, numerical equality, shallow list equality, deep list equality, string equality, and even "fuzzy" floating-point equality. Which is the right to choose in any given situation? Which should i use for my equals() method on my custom object?</p> <p>This paper answers all of these questions, by taking a seemingly complex problem and revealing an underlying simplicity. It does this by defining one equality operation that works in any situation.</p> <p>The paper makes use of lisp syntax, but the ideas are applicable to most modern languages.</p> <p>

      <p>Ricardo Monti from Imperial College London will presenting Distributed Optimization and Statistical Learning via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers by Stephen Boyd, Neal Parikh, Eric Chu, Borja Peleato and Jonathan Eckstein.</p> <p><br/>Doors open at 6:30 pm; the presentation will begin at 7:00 pm.</p> <p>We hope that you'll take a look at <a href="http://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/admm_distr_stats.pdf">the paper</a> before the Meetup (and if you don't, no worries).</p> <p>



      Many modern statistics and machine learning problems can be recast as optimization problems where we look to minimize a convex objective function.</p> <p>The resulting objective function enforces a set of desirable properties which we wish our answer to possess: a popular example would be sparsity (i.e., we wish to obtain a sparse answer for reasons of interpretability or for other reasons).</p> <p>However, it is often the case that minimizing such objective functions is difficult. While there have been many solutions proposed in the literature, each of these tends to focus on a specific problem.</p> <p>The proposed paper describes a powerful optimization algorithm called the Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM) - a conceptually simple method with which to solve a wide range of convex optimization problems  in an "off-the-shelf" manner.</p> <p>The ADMM algorithm works by exploiting the separable structure of many objective functions. By splitting the objective into a likelihood term and a penalization term, it is able to iteratively minimize the objective function with respect to each. As it turns out, each of these optimization steps is usually much simpler than the original problem (and in many cases has a closed form solution!). As a result, complex, high-dimensional problems can be broken down into a series of simple, 1-dimensional problems.</p>

    description: <p>Relational programming, or logic programming, is a programming paradigm that exhibits remarkable and powerful properties, to the extent that its implementation seems frightfully daunting to the layman. µKanren is a minimal relational language that seeks to strip the paradigm down to its core, leaving us with a succinct, elegant and above all <i>simple</i> set of primitives on top of which we can rebuild even the most powerful relational constructs.</p> <p>In this talk, we will explore the µKanren language by implementing it from first principles in a simple functional programming language, going on to demonstrate how you can assemble these simple building blocks into a semblance of its richer parent, miniKanren, and maybe solve a logic puzzle or two to make sure it’s working as advertised.</p> <p>The µKanren paper, and the original µKanren implementation, were authored by Jason Hemann and Daniel P. Friedman. The paper is available at <a href="http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf"><a href="http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf" class="linkified">http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf</a></a>, and the Scheme implementation at <a href="https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren"><a href="https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren" class="linkified">https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren</a></a>.</p> <p>About Bodil:<br/>A compulsive conference speaker in the fields of functional programming and internets technologies, and a co-organiser of multiple developer conferences in Scandinavia and the UK, mostly because she’s still learning how to stop.</p>

    description: <p><b>The paper:</b></p> <p>Bryan Ford's 2002 Masters Thesis is remarkable in that it breaks decades of compiler-construction dogma with some simple principles and a compelling alternative to the complexity of parsing with context-free grammars (CFGs). He reveals a forgotten class of grammars-- top-down parsing language (TDPL), and some extensions known as parsing-expression grammars (PEGS) -- that directly correspond to the parsers that implement them. His primary contribution, however, is applying modern functional programming techniques of laziness and algebraic data structures to make TDPL/PEG parsers computationally efficient.</p> <p>The paper can be found here: <a href="http://bford.info/pub/lang/thesis.pdf"><a href="http://bford.info/pub/lang/thesis.pdf" class="linkified">http://bford.info/pub/lang/thesis.pdf</a></a></p> <p><b>About our speaker:</b></p> <p>Sean Cribbs is a Software Engineer at Basho Technologies, where he has contributed to many aspects of Riak, the distributed database and regularly hacks in Erlang, Python, Ruby and JavaScript. Prior to Basho, Sean was a freelance developer and consultant who also managed the development of the open-source Radiant web publishing system. Sean enjoys playing the piano in his free time.</p>

    description: <p><b>The Paper:</b></p> <p>The probabilistic test for primality presented in Michael Rabin's 1977 paper is interesting because prime numbers are at the center of several high-profile algorithm problems, and because probabilistic "proofs" in general challenge naive notions of mathematical certainty. This talk will start by motivating the problem of primality testing, describe the algorithm, and do as much as is humanly possible to make the correctness proof accessible to people who don't read about number theory in their free time.</p> <p><br/>The paper can be found here: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022314X80900840" class="linkified">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022314X80900840</a></p> <p><b>About Our Speaker:</b></p> <p>Gary Fredericks once stood up for the entirety of a two-hour Greyhound ride because there weren't any available seats because at that point Greyhound didn't guarantee seats with your ticket and you just had to wait for the next bus on the same route if there weren't enough seats and but how on earth are you supposed to get your connecting bus in that situation.</p> <p>Gary Fredericks once went on a road trip with Mike Busch where he passed the time by factoring the mile markers on the highway and Mike Busch hasn't invited him on a road trip again. </p>

    description: <p><b>The Paper:<br/></b> As the first published paper describing the Lisp language, John McCarthy's 1960 paper "Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions..." introduces some familiar, and some maybe not familiar concepts of Lisp in their earliest form. This talk will take a look at concepts like M-expressions, S-expressions, functions, and forms, and will walk through McCarthy's definitions of core Lisp functions like apply and eval. We'll also discuss the paper's description of the computer representation and translation of Lisp and recursive functions.</p> <p>The paper can be found <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/raw/master/comp_sci_fundamentals_and_history/recursive-functions-of-symbolic-expressions-and-their-computation-by-machine-parti.pdf">here</a>.</p> <p><b>The Speaker:</b><br/>Kevin Buchanan is a software developer at 8th Light, where he currently enjoys getting to write Lisp with Clojure every day.</p>

    description: <p><b>The Paper:</b><br/>The Zookeeper paper describes a toolkit for building coordinated distributed systems, which is itself built upon lower-level concepts like consensus, linearizability, and atomic broadcast. Though we sometimes think of tools like distributed locks, rendezvous, group membership, and barriers as primitives, they actually can be, and are often in practice, built on top of Zookeeper. We'll dig into what makes Zookeeper tick, and why it's useful for real-world distributed systems.</p> <p>The paper can be found <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/raw/master/distributed_systems/zookeeper-wait-free-coordination-for-internet-scale-systems.pdf">here</a>.</p> <p><b>The Speaker:</b><br/>If Colin Jones loves this paper so much, why doesn't he marry it? Suspicious.

      in Apple and Netscape software. Back at UC Berkeley, he worked on vehicle automation,
      communication, control, and safety systems, and on data analysis and simulation
      of transportation networks. Now he works on Tupelo, a transactional tuplespace
      sharing some of the ideas of Calvin, and RedShift, a simulation framework in

      words:  "<i>It''s a very short physics paper--a sidenote, really, to work he

      sidenote his defining work--it gave rise to one of the weirdest physics phenomena
      ever, and has only gotten *more* confusing since the original proof. There''s
      a really interesting history behind it that reveals some of the sociology of
      academia. Plus it''s just fucking fascinating physics.</i></p> <p><i>It also
      doesn''t require any math beyond, say, high school calculus, but illustrates
      what a rigorous formal argument looks like--and I''m well-prepared to teach
      the math and concepts to an audience without any mathematical expertise. I think
      it''d be a really interesting contrast to some of the more industry-oriented
      papers we''ve seen recently.</i></p> <p><i>The value here isn''t in direct applicability

Leif will present the <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/data_structures/level-ancestor-simplified.pdf">Level Ancestor Simplified</a> paper by Bender and Farach-Colton.</p> <p>Leif tells us: " My favorite problems are always those with the highest ratio of difficulty in solving to difficulty in stating.  The <i>lowest common ancestor</i> problem exemplifies this.  It was first stated in <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=800125.804056">1973</a>, and can be described to anyone in two sentences, or with one sentence and a picture.  But it took 11 years before an optimal solution was discovered, and another 16 before an understandable and implementable solution with the same bounds was presented, in this paper, <i>The LCA Problem Revisited</i>.  This problem is furthermore satisfying because its bounds are so tight: pre-processing takes as long as just reading the input, and queries are constant time.</p> <p>


      <i>The LCA Problem Revisited</i> is a wonderfully curated journey through a deceptively simple problem that comes together in the end in a beautiful way, and it uses techniques that are powerful in plenty of other places.  Plus, it solves another bonus problem along the way!"</p> <p>


      <b>Note:</b> If you can't get enough of Tree Data Structures Leif will also be presenting on Wednesday, November 12 at Heavybit.

      <p><a href="http://twitter.com/pbailis">Peter Bailis</a> presents the "Managing Update Conflicts in Bayou, A Weakly Connected Replicated Storage System" paper by Doug Terry, Marvin Theimer, Karin Petersen, Alan J. Demers, Mike J. Spreitzer, and Carl H. Hauser in SOSP 1995. <a href="http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/cs286/papers/bayou-sosp1995.pdf"><a href="http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/cs286/papers/bayou-sosp1995.pdf" class="linkified">http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/cs286/papers/bayou-sosp1995.pdf</a></a></p> <p>

      Peter tells us: "A perennial challenge in managing shared, mutable state in distributed systems is the ability to permit concurrent writes while maintaining some degree of application "correctness." Bayou is an excellent and early example of an "optimistic" strategy for handling the concurrent update problem. Many of the techniques in Bayou---such as dependency tracking, application-specific merge procedures, and log shipping---are increasingly popular, can be found in systems like Dynamo, and help understand when and why mechanisms like CRDTs are useful."</p> <p> If you have any questions, thoughts, or related information, please visit our *github-thread* on the matter:  <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/193"><a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/193" class="linkified">https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/193</a></a></p> <p>

      <p><b>Introducing PWL Mini!! </b></p> <p>Starting this month we'll be opening up two 5-7 minute talk slots before our main talk. The idea is to share with the group a short summary of a paper or an idea that you are super excited about. Anyone can volunteer minis, just email us!</p> <p>•<b> Mini #1</b>:  <a href="https://twitter.com/sargun">Sargun Dhillon</a> on <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/80693/vl2-sigcomm09-final.pdf">VL2</a>,  a paper by Microsoft Research about computer networking. VL2 leverages several novel schemes in order to build full-bisection, highly-scalable, and decentralized datacenter networks in an economical fashion. These networks continue to support the layer 2 and flat addressing semantics. Many modern networks have been greatly influenced by this design.</p> <p>Sargun Dhillon (<a href="https://gist.github.com/sargun/twitter.com/sargun">@sargun</a>) is highly interested in schemes for efficient, flexible computer networks to enable the next generation of applications. He currently works at <a href="http://mustwin.com/">MustWin</a>. He comes from an operations background, and spends much of his time thinking about how we can make distributed systems, networking, and databases friendlier to run.</p> <p>------------------</p> <p><b>Main Talk:</b></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/alexras">Alex Rasmussen</a> presents the "<a href="http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2014/papers/fds.pdf">Flat Datacenter Storage</a>" paper by Edmund B. Nightingale, Jeremy Elson,Jinliang Fan, Owen Hofmann, Jon Howell, and Yutaka Suzue. <a href="http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2014/papers/fds.pdf" class="linkified">http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2014/papers/fds.pdf</a></p> <p>Alex tells us: " Flat Datacenter Storage (FDS) is, as the intro describes, "a high-performance, fault-tolerant, large-scale, locality-oblivious blob store". It's also a great example of how carefully thought-out co-design of software and hardware for a target workload can yield really impressive performance results, even in the presence of heterogeneity and operating at scale. In my (admittedly biased) opinion, this style of system design doesn't get enough attention outside of academia, and has a lot to teach us about how data-intensive systems should be designed."</p> <p> If you have any questions, thoughts, or related information, please visit our *github-thread* on the matter: <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/198"><a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/198" class="linkified">https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/198</a></a></p> <p>

      <p><b>PWL Minis</b></p> <p>

      We have two 5-7 minute talks before our main presentation where a short summary of a paper or an exciting idea is shared. Anyone can sign up for a mini, just email us!</p> <p>

      • Mini #1: <a href="https://twitter.com/nerdonica">Veronica Ray</a> on Experimenting At Scale With Google Chrome’s SSL Warning (<a href="http://www.adrienneporterfelt.com/chi-ssl-experiment.pdf"><a href="http://www.adrienneporterfelt.com/chi-ssl-experiment.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.adrienneporterfelt.com/chi-ssl-experiment.pdf</a></a>). From Veronica: "<i>Whether we are surfing the web or developing applications, browser security affects us all. This study from 2014 is the first to demonstrate why real users disregard browser security warnings. Its conclusions about the impact of warning design are surprising and inspire reflection about what we as developers can do to keep our users safe."</i></p> <p>

      • Mini #2: <a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/13353208602533882282">Gareth Morgan</a> on  The Rendering Equation (<a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~cutler/classes/advancedgraphics/S08/lectures/kajiya.pdf"><a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~cutler/classes/advancedgraphics/S08/lectures/kajiya.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~cutler/classes/advancedgraphics/S08/lectures/kajiya.pdf</a></a>). From Gareth: <i>"</i><i>This paper is one of the most important 3D graphics papers in the subject's history.  It is the foundation of many of the rendering techniques used in modern graphics.  I will give a short overview of the rendering equation and why it is so important for 3D graphics.  This will be a taster of my full talk on this paper which I will be giving later in the year"</i></p> <p>






      <b>Main Talk</b></p> <p>


      <a href="https://twitter.com/caitiem20">Caitie McCaffrey</a> stops by and talks about the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/210931/Orleans-MSR-TR-2014-41.pdf">Orleans: Distributed Virtual Actors for Programmability and Scalability</a> paper by Bernstein, Bykov, Geller, Kliot, and Thelin.</p> <p>

      Orleans is a runtime and programming model for building scalable distributed systems, based on the actor model.  The Orleans programming model introduces the abstraction of Virtual Actors.  Orleans allows applications to obtain high performance, reliability, and scalability.  This technology was developed by the eXtreme Computing Group at Microsoft Research and was a core component of the Azure Services that supported that powered Halo 4, the award winning video game. </p> <p>

      <p><b>PWL Mini</b></p> <p><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/adereth">Matt Adereth</a> on "<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.30.5736">The Mode Tree: A Tool for Visualization of Nonparametric Density Features</a>"(<a href="http://adereth.github.io/oneoff/Mode%20Trees.pdf" class="linkified">http://adereth.github.io/oneoff/Mode%20Trees.pdf</a>).  From Matt: "<i>We often look at summaries of univariate data using basic descriptive statistics like mean and standard deviation and visualizations like histograms and box plots.  The Mode Tree is a powerful alternative visualization that reveals important details about our distributions that none of the standard approaches can show.</i></p> <p><i>I particularly like this paper because it was really the by-product of some interesting algorithmic work in Computational Statistics.  A lot of the techniques in this area are pretty math heavy and inaccessible, so I appreciated that they dedicated a paper to making a visualization that helps explain the inner workings.  As a bonus, the visualization stands on its own as a useful tool."</i></p> <p><b>Matt's Bio</b></p> <p>Matt Adereth builds tools and infrastructure for quantitative analysis at Two Sigma.  He previously worked at Microsoft on Visio, focusing on ways to connect data to shapes.</p> <p><br/><b>Main Talk </b></p> <p><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/armon">Armon Dadgar</a> from HashiCorp takes us on a deep dive of Bloom filters and HyperLogLog.</p> <p>Bloom filter papers:</p> <p>* <a href="http://www.cs.upc.edu/~diaz/p422-bloom.pdf"><a href="http://www.cs.upc.edu/~diaz/p422-bloom.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.cs.upc.edu/~diaz/p422-bloom.pdf</a></a></p> <p>* <a href="http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/members/cbm/ps/dbloom.pdf"><a href="http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/members/cbm/ps/dbloom.pdf" class="linkified">http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/members/cbm/ps/dbloom.pdf</a></a></p> <p>* <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/%7Ekirsch/pubs/bbbf/esa06.pdf"><a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/%7Ekirsch/pubs/bbbf/esa06.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/%7Ekirsch/pubs/bbbf/esa06.pdf</a></a></p> <p>Armon will mostly touch on the first  paper which is the introduction of the technique. The other two are optimizations that he'll discuss briefly but there's no need to dwell on them.</p> <p>HyperLogLog papers:</p> <p>* <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.142.9475"><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.142.9475" class="linkified">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.142.9475</a></a></p> <p>* <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub40671.html"><a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub40671.html" class="linkified">http://research.google.com/pubs/pub40671.html</a></a></p> <p>Again, the first one introduces them, and the second one is some optimizations from Google. He won’t spend much time on the second one either.</p> <p>All of these papers are implemented as part of:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/armon/bloomd"><a href="https://github.com/armon/bloomd" class="linkified">https://github.com/armon/bloomd</a></a></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/armon/hlld"><a href="https://github.com/armon/hlld" class="linkified">https://github.com/armon/hlld</a></a></p> <p>These links may give some context to the work and show the real-world applicability.</p> <p>From Armon on why he loves these papers: <i>"Bloom Filters and HyperLogLog are incredible for their simplicity and the seemingly impossible behavior they have. Both of them are part of the family of “sketching” data structures, which allow for a controllable error that results in a tremendous savings of memory compared to the equivalent exact implementations.</i></p> <p><i>More than just being elegant, these two data structures enable some very cool real-world use cases. In the online advertising company I previously worked for, we used them to track thousands of metrics across billions of data points comfortably in memory on a single machine. "</i></p> <p><i><br/></i></p> <p><b>Armon's Bio</b></p> <p>Armon has a passion for distributed systems and their application to real world problems. He is currently the CTO of HashiCorp, where he brings distributed systems into the world of DevOps tooling. He has worked on Terraform, Consul, and Serf at HashiCorp, and maintains the Statsite and Bloomd OSS projects as well.</p> <p>


      <b>Meeting mechanics </b></p> <p>Doors open at 6:30 pm; the presentation will begin at 7:00 pm; and, yes, there will be food provided. </p> <p>After the paper is presented, we will open up the floor for discussion and questions.  </p> <p>We have selected a post meetup bar!

      <p><b>Mini</b></p> <p><a href="http://twitter.com/dijkstracula">Nathan Taylor</a> on "Your computer is already a distributed system. Why isn’t your OS?" (<a href="http://www.barrelfish.org/barrelfish_hotos09.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.barrelfish.org/barrelfish_hotos09.pdf</a>). </p> <p>From Nathan: <i>"This is one in a long line of papers advocating for a loosely-coupled, service-oriented operating system architecture, an argument that extends back to the dawn of systems research.  Alternative OSs like microkernels have long been considered more stable and easier to reason about by the systems community, but the performance overhead that comes with running them means typically our OSs still resemble the ones from the '60s.  The authors have spun the "it will be too slow" argument on its head by extrapolating hardware trends and adopting terminology from the distributed systems community, and end up making a compelling case for their design not only being the _only_ path forward, but the time is now to begin adopting their techniques.  The paper is punchy, argues its point cogently, and served as a springboard for further work by the same group of researchers."</i></p> <p>


      <b>Nathan's Bio</b></p> <p>Nathan is currently working on low-latency content distribution at <a href="http://www.fastly.com">Fastly</a> and has previously hacked on improving the performance of language runtimes and OS hypervisors. His first exposure to OS research came as a graduate student at the University of British Columbia.</p> <p>

      <p><b>PWL Mini</b></p> <p>TBD</p> <p>


      <b>Main talk</b></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/jasobrown">Jason Brown</a> on the Epidemic Algorithms for Replicated Database Maintenance paper (<a href="http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/xerox/parc/techReports/CSL-89-1_Epidemic_Algorithms_for_Replicated_Database_Maintenance.pdf" class="linkified">http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/xerox/parc/techReports/CSL-89-1_Epidemic_Algorithms_for_Replicated_Database_Maintenance.pdf</a>). </p> <p>From Jason: <i>"While published in 1987, it describes an early system that uses gossip replication and eventual consistency (the latter is uncannily like modern NoSQL databases). </i></p> <p><i>The subject of gossip branched into some interesting directions since the '80s, I'd concentrate on the Demers paper, and few others in the 'replication via gossip' vein, and then tie that into some modern, well-known systems (cassandra and riak)." </i></p> <p>

      <p><br/>More details:</p> <p>Many of you have mentioned about this clashing
      with a talk at FuConf on property-based testing but I suggest we go through
      with this because I not only plan to cover QuickCheck but also motivate the
      topic with a little generality with respect to functional programming (to cater
      to those with a background mainly in imperative languages). Here is an outline
      of things I will cover</p> <p>Each of these below will be illustrated with plenty
      of code examples</p> <p><br/>- Why are tests needed? This is not as obvious
      as it seems when viewed from the point-of-view of the Curry-Howard isomorphism
      (this will also serve as a hook for a future talk someone will inevitably want
      to do on type systems)</p> <p><br/>- How Haskell and other functional and type-safe
      languages can reduce testing needs</p> <p><br/>- What types can tell you about
      code functionality</p> <p>- Types can get you far but not totally... so testing
      begins. Starting with the familiar method of unit testing</p> <p>- An alternative
      mode of testing: invariance testing. Introducing QuickCheck. Include other motivations
      for invariance testing (from the model-checking world... successfully used in
      hardware and driver testing)</p> <p>- Work through the paper</p> <p>- Real-world
      uses of QuickCheck in Haskell packages (vector, lens, etc)</p> <p>- Integration
      with unit tests and cabal (if people are interested)</p> <p>- and ... pointing
      to further reading</p> <p>Let me know what you guys think.</p> <p>Thanks,</p>
      <p>Naren</p>'

    description: <p> Paxos and Raft are two algorithms for getting one answer from a group of unreliable processors. Some of the more popular use-cases for such algorithms are leader election, distributed locking, distributed log replication and so on.</p> <p>Paxos was originally presented by Leslie Lamport in a very entertaining paper (that was rejected for publication many times). However, generalized Paxos is considered extremely hard to implement. </p> <p>Raft was born as a easy to understand consensus algorithm and had several implementations to its credit. </p> <p>In this session, I am planning to go over the problem of distributed log replication, walk through Paxos and its derivatives and then go through Raft. We can take a quick shot at implementing it, if time permits. </p>

      <p><b>Functional Geometry</b> - <a href="http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/peter/funcgeo.pdf" class="linkified">http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/peter/funcgeo.pdf</a> and <a href="http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/257577/1/funcgeo2.pdf" class="linkified">http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/257577/1/funcgeo2.pdf</a></p> <p>&lt;rant&gt;</p> <p>Imperative programming is rooted in compulsively thinking of programs as a sequence of instructions given to a machine that manipulates a set of bits. Bits represent state: each bit can be in 2 states, 10 bits in 1024 states, a 100 in 1e301 states. No matter whatever high level abstractions you create for talking about these primitive bits (floats, points, lines, boxes, polygons, fish), as long as you are writing programs that work with state, you are bound to run into this combinatorial explosion as you add complexity. We humans are really bad at keeping track of states in our heads! An average person can keep <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">7 ± 2</a> things in his/her working memory. What we are good at though, is <i>narratives and descriptions</i>...</p> <p><br/>The timeless paradigm of functional programming emphasizes thinking of programs as consisting of pure functions akin to mathematical identities. This decouples programming from the idea that programs have to be written for a computer, and as a series of instructions. Instead, in FP, we <i>describe</i> the world and the system we want to create in terms of its constituent parts, which, in turn, are similarly <i>described</i> in terms of their constituent parts.</p> <p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p> <p>Peter Henderson's "Functional Geometry" simply provides an example of a well-written functional program. In particular, the author builds a sequence of functions which start off by describing lines on a 2D plane and build up to a description of an intricate <a href="http://www.mcescher.com/">Escher</a> woodcut called <a href="http://www.wikiart.org/en/m-c-escher/square-limit">Square Limit</a> (final result in the figure). In the process, the author offers insights into how to write other such well-written functional programs.</p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/2/0/a/600_432021002.jpeg" /></p> <p><i>                                    A 600x600 grid of bits!</i></p> <p><br/>In this session we can plan to discuss:</p> <p>

      • Primitives for describing geometry of lines on a 2D plane</p> <p>• <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node29.html">Abstraction barriers</a>, and layered design of a richer set of functions (the fish and its poses)</p> <p>• The description of Square Limit</p> <p>• An implementation of a system to draw the primitives</p> <p>• History of this paper, and how other notable works make references to it</p> <p>• (Discussion) concrete lessons you can apply in your day-to-day programming - I am expecting this discussion to be a blast!</p>

    description: <p>I will be talking about Hyperloglog, a cardinality (i.e. number of distinct elements) <i>estimation</i> algorithm. In general, counting the number of elements in a set gets harder as the number of sets increase. For e.g., you might want to count number of users from a country.. i.e. number of sets is just 200+ and you can use a map of country to count. But, if you want to count the number of unique visitors to a popular website, then the number of sets become really large.</p> <p>Probabilistic counting methods give a way to estimate the cardinality of sets without keeping track of every single item. Hyperloglog is probably the best known of those methods. </p> <p>Paper: <a href="http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf"><a href="http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf" class="linkified">http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf</a></a></p>

    description: <p>Stackless Scala with Free Monads is a fairly easy to read paper with many practical applications. It introduces trampolines as a means to avoid stackoverflow errors on programming languages of the JVM and generalizes them into the Free Monad, a structure which can help writing monadic expressions for any type constructor if a functor is defined. Free monads can be useful in tackling the expression problem which is part of another paper.</p> <p>The paper can be found here:</p> <p><a href="http://blog.higher-order.com/assets/trampolines.pdf"><a href="http://blog.higher-order.com/assets/trampolines.pdf" class="linkified">http://blog.higher-order.com/assets/trampolines.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/>and you are expected to have at least tried to read it when coming to the meetup so that we can efficiently discuss it.</p>

    description: <p><b>The Essence of the Iterator pattern </b>treats iterating over collections as two problems, which exhibit traversal of collections (and modifying the content) and accumulating values based on the contents.  Jeremy Gibbons and Bruno C.d.S. Oliveira show how <b>Applicative Functors</b> and related type classes can be used in functional programming to solve these problems.</p> <p>Paper: <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/iterator.pdf"><a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/iterator.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/iterator.pdf</a></a></p> <p>The paper is widely quoted amongst the functional programming community and illustrates nicely how recent acadamic research (Applicative Functors, McBride, 2008) finds its way into language design and application of functional programming languages such as Scala or Haskell.</p>

    description: '<p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>Immutable vectors are a convenient data
      structure for functional programming and part of the standard library of modern
      languages like Clojure and Scala. The common implementation is based on wide
      trees with a fixed number of children per node, which allows fast indexed lookup
      and update operations. In this paper, the authors extend the vector data type
      with a new underlying data structure, Relaxed Radix Balanced Trees (RRB-Trees),
      and show how this structure allows immutable vector concatenation, insert-at
      and splits in O(logN) time while maintaining the index, update and iteration
      speeds of the original vector data structure.</p> <p><br/>Chris Bilson will

      <b>Abstract</b></p> <p>





      Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers. Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance. These applications place very different demands on Bigtable, both in terms of data size (from URLs to web pages to satellite imagery) and latency requirements (from backend bulk processing to real-time data serving). Despite these varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible, high-performance solution for all of these Google products. In this paper we describe the simple data model provided by Bigtable, which gives clients dynamic control over data layout and format, and we describe the design and implementation of Bigtable.</p> <p>





      Arunabha Ghosh, director of Engineering at Moz, will be presenting this paper. Before Moz, Arunabha spend around 7 years at Google working on large scale distributed systems. I hope to see all of you for an insightful discussion.</p> <p>

    description: '<p><i>We will be covering the paper that launched many other NoSQL
      databases over the years. Apache Cassandra, Voldemort, Riak to name a few.</i></p>
      <p><b>ABSTRACT </b>Reliability at massive scale is one of the biggest challenges
      we face at Amazon.com, one of the largest e-commerce operations in the world;
      even the slightest outage has significant financial consequences and impacts
      customer trust. The Amazon.com platform, which provides services for many web
      sites worldwide, is implemented on top of an infrastructure of tens of thousands
      of servers and network components located in many datacenters around the world.
      At this scale, small and large components fail continuously and the way persistent
      state is managed in the face of these failures drives the reliability and scalability
      of the software systems. This paper presents the design and implementation of
      Dynamo, a highly available key-value storage system that some of Amazon’s core
      services use to provide an “always-on” experience. To achieve this level of
      availability, Dynamo sacrifices consistency under certain failure scenarios.
      It makes extensive use of object versioning and application-assisted conflict
      resolution in a manner that provides a novel interface for developers to use.

    description: <p>we're excited to have <a href="https://twitter.com/BrandonBloom">Brandon Bloom</a> presenting the paper <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/plt/programming-with-algebraic-effects-and-handlers.pdf?raw=true">Programming with Algebraic Effects and Handlers</a> by Andrej Bauer and Matija Pretnar.</p> <p><b>Intro</b></p> <p>Some great papers embody insights, others package up those insights into digestible bites. "Programing with Algebraic Effects and Handlers" is the later sort of great paper. After two decades of fundamental research in to the nature of computation, a lot of mysterious ideas in computer science such as continuations and exception handling finally made sense to a number of mathematically inclined geniuses. Bauer and Pretnar's Eff programming language cuts right through the heart of the theory in a way that makes sense to anybody who has ever written a functional program. This paper uses the Eff language to explore a number of simple computational effects that were traditionally viewed as quite varied and complex.</p> <p><b>Brandon's Bio</b></p> <p>Brandon Bloom walks a fine line between laser focused pragmatism and broad academic interests. Most recently in his varied career, Brandon worked on Code.org's Hour Of Code campaign. In the past, he's founded and sold a startup, as well as worked on Microsoft Xbox and Google Translate. Now, he's indulging his inner scientist and exploring technology for his next venture.

    description: '<p>For our first meetup Ólafur R. Helgason will present and lead
      the discussion on <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/ton:chord/paper-ton.pdf">Chord:
      A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Protocol for Internet Applications</a>.</p> <p>We
      hope to see as many as possible and I hope we can make these meetups a regular
      thing.</p> <p><b>Abstract<br/></b>A fundamental problem that confronts peer-to-peer
      applications is the efficient location of the node that stores a desired data
      item. This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses
      this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it
      maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of
      Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data pair
      at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and
      leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously
      changing. Results from theoretical analysis and simulations show that Chord
      is scalable: communication cost and the state maintained by each node scale
      logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes. </p> <p><b>Bio</b><br/>Ólafur

      Since we've already covered <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Vienna/events/218624428/">Google's Bigtable</a>, we're taking an in-depth look at the second forerunner of the NoSQL movement: Dynamo, which is pretty <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/de/dynamodb/">popular in practise</a> as well.</p> <p>

      Again, please read the <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">paper</a> in advance so we can have a lively discussion — led by <a href="https://twitter.com/xeraa">me</a> this time :)</p> <p>

      And please propose the next paper you want to dissect. Ideally, it's something more theoretical since we agreed to alternate between theoretical and practical papers.</p> <p>

      See you there,<br/>Philipp</p>

    description: <p>For the very first Papers We Love Berlin Meetup, we will have Erik Michaels-Ober from SoundCloud presenting the paper Soft Typing by Robert Cartwright and Mike Fagan.</p> <p>This is particularly interesting for Rubyists, because Ruby 3.0 might ship with such a type system.</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>This paper presents a soft type systems that retains the expressiveness of dynamic typing, but offers the early error detection and improved optimization capabilities of static typing. The key idea underlying soft typing is that a type checker need not reject programs containing "ill-typed" phrases. Instead, the type checker can insert explicit run-time checks, transforming "ill-typed" programs into type-correct ones.</p> <p>PDF: <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.9333&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.9333&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" class="linkified">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.9333&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a></a></p> <p>Thanks to ResearchGate for hosting this first edition!</p>

    <p>Berlin chapter of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love">http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love</a> </p>
    <p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss in a low ego, friendly environment. </p>
    <p>We'll be using and improving papers-we-love's curated <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">repository</a>. Please contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories. We will be recording talks and they will appear on the shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PapersWeLove">Youtube</a> account.</p>
    <p>Please read and follow the <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/a2c25daeb0ab70ef7723d13dcfab3c420910ec8d/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code Of Conduct</a>, please let one of the organisers know if anything makes you uncomfortable.</p>

    description: <p>This our inaugural Meetup, and we're excited to have <a href="http://michaelrbernste.in/">Michael Bernstein</a> presenting the paper <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cs415/reading/bacon-garbage.pdf">A Uniﬁed Theory of Garbage Collection</a> by David F. Bacon, Perry Cheng, and V.T. Rajan. </p> <p>Doors open at 7 pm; the presentation will begin at 7:30 pm; and, yes, there will be beer and pizza.   </p> <p>After Michael presents the paper, we will open up the floor to discussion and questions.  </p> <p>We hope that you'll read the paper before the Meetup (and if you don't, no worries, be happy now!), and if you have any questions, thoughts, or related information, please visit our *github-thread* on the matter: <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/1"><a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/1" class="linkified">https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/1</a></a>.</p> <p>Additionally, if you have any papers you want to add to the repository above, please send us a pull request. </p> <p><b>Michael's Bio: </b></p> <p>Mike Bernstein is obsessed. Not with anything in particular, just in general. He's a Brooklyn, NYC based software developer and amateur Computer Scientist who writes at <a href="http://michaelrbernste.in/"><a href="http://michaelrbernste.in" class="linkified">http://michaelrbernste.in</a></a> and tweets (too much) at <a href="https://twitter.com/mrb_bk">@mrb_bk</a>. He's given talks on Garbage Collection and Distributed Systems in the past and is very excited to hang and chat with fellow NYC obsessives.</p>

    description: <p>For our second meetup, we're excited to have <a href="https://twitter.com/BrandonBloom">Brandon Bloom</a> presenting the paper <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/plt/programming-with-algebraic-effects-and-handlers.pdf?raw=true">Programming with Algebraic Effects and Handlers</a> by Andrej Bauer and Matija Pretnar.</p> <p><b>Intro</b></p> <p>Some great papers embody insights, others package up those insights into digestible bites. "Programing with Algebraic Effects and Handlers" is the later sort of great paper. After two decades of fundamental research in to the nature of computation, a lot of mysterious ideas in computer science such as continuations and exception handling finally made sense to a number of mathematically inclined geniuses. Bauer and Pretnar's Eff programming language cuts right through the heart of the theory in a way that makes sense to anybody who has ever written a functional program. This paper uses the Eff language to explore a number of simple computational effects that were traditionally viewed as quite varied and complex.</p> <p><b>Brandon's Bio</b></p> <p>Brandon Bloom walks a fine line between laser focused pragmatism and broad academic interests. Most recently in his varied career, Brandon worked on Code.org's Hour Of Code campaign. In the past, he's founded and sold a startup, as well as worked on Microsoft Xbox and Google Translate. Now, he's indulging his inner scientist and exploring technology for his next venture. Find him on the web at &lt;<a href="http://www.brandonbloom.name/"><a href="http://www.brandonbloom.name/" class="linkified">http://www.brandonbloom.name/</a></a>&gt;.</p> <p><b>Details</b></p> <p>Doors open at 7 pm; the presentation will begin at 7:30 pm; and, yes, there will be beer and pizza. </p> <p>After Brandon presents the paper, we will open up the floor to discussion and questions.  </p> <p>We hope that you'll read the paper before the meetup, but don't stress if you never get around to it, and if you have any questions, thoughts, or related information, please visit our *<a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/9">github-thread</a>* on the matter.</p> <p>Additionally, if you have any papers you want to add to the repository above, please send us a pull request. Also, if you have any ideas/questions about this meetup or the Papers-We-Love org, just open up an issue.</p>

      <p>We're thrilled to have <a href="https://github.com/dgrnbrg">David Greenberg</a> presenting <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/matei/papers/2013/sosp_sparrow.pdf">Sparrow: Distributed, Low Latency Scheduling</a> by Kay Ousterhout, Patrick Wendell, Matei Zaharia and Ion Stoica. </p> <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p> <p>When you need to execute code on a cluster of machines, deciding which machine should run that code becomes a complex problem, known as scheduling. We're all familiar with routing problems, such as the recent <a href="http://news.rapgenius.com/James-somers-herokus-ugly-secret-annotated">RapGenius incident</a>. It turns out that simple improvements to randomized routing can dramatically improve the performance! Sparrow is a distributed scheduling algorithm for low latency, high throughput workloads. We'll review the Sparrow algorithm, and learn the tricks that they used. Then, we'll discuss other applications of Sparrow, besides the big-data map-reduce application it was created for. </p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>David Greenberg loves learning. He currently works at Two Sigma, where he leads several efforts to build reliable, distributed cluster computing environments. He enjoys reading a good paper with glass of scotch on a cold winter night. Given this winter, there's been a lot of papers :)</p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/8/c/600_348067052.jpeg" /></p> <p>


      <b>Details</b></p> <p>Doors open at 7 pm; the presentation will begin at 7:30 pm; and, yes, there will be beer and pizza. </p> <p>After David presents the paper, we will open up the floor to discussion and questions.  </p> <p>We hope that you'll read the paper before the meetup, but don't stress if you never get around to it, and if you have any questions, thoughts, or related information, please visit our *<a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/89">github-thread</a>* on the matter.</p> <p>Additionally, if you have any papers you want to add to the repository above, please send us a pull request. Also, if you have any ideas/questions about this meetup or the Papers-We-Love org, just open up an issue.</p>

    description: '<p>We''re ecstatic to have <b>Chas Emerick</b> presenting <a href="http://hal.upmc.fr/docs/00/55/55/88/PDF/techreport.pdf">A
      comprehensive study of Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types</a> by Marc
      Shapiro, Nuno Preguiça, Carlos Baquero, and Marek Zawirski (2011). </p> <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p>
      <p><a href="http://hal.upmc.fr/docs/00/55/55/88/PDF/techreport.pdf">''A comprehensive
      study of Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types''</a> by Shapiro et
      al.</p> <p>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are a formalism for providing
      practical data and programming primitives for use in distributed systems applications
      without necessitating expensive (and sometimes impractical) consensus mechanisms.
       Their key characteristic is that they provide conflict-free "merging" of distributed
      concurrent updates given only the weak guarantees of eventual consistency.</p>
      <p><br/>While this paper did not coin the term ''CRDT'', it was the first to
      provide a comprehensive treatment of their definition, semantics, and possible
      construction separate from and beyond previous implementations of distributable
      datatypes that happened to provide CRDT-like semantics.</p> <p>In the paper,
      the authors:</p> <p>• Construct a modern taxonomy of data types that can be
      characterized has having desirable conflict-resolution properties given multiple
      distributed, concurrent actors manipulating shared data without coordination
      or consensus (a.k.a. "eventual consistency").</p> <p>• Describe a set of formal
      properties necessary to implement these data types, defining both local programming
      interfaces and distributed replication semantics and requirements.</p> <p><i>Related
      topics: Eventual consistency, consensus, CAP theorem, (semi-)lattices, Bloom(L),
      operational transforms, data replication</i></p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p><a href="http://cemerick.com">Chas

    description: <p>In June, we have the pleasure of hearing Aysylu Greenberg, Software Engineer at Google and maintainer of the Clojure library <a href="https://github.com/aysylu/loom">Loom</a>, speaking on the paper "One VM to Rule Them All" by Thomas Wuerthinger, Christian Wimmer, et al.</p> <p><b>Paper</b></p> <p>You can find the paper in the <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/bc15cfbe998b9dbde6c76480f9264e968e19155d/virtual_machines/README.md">PWL repository</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/gkrichar/papers/onward2013-wuerthinger-truffle.pdf">here</a>.</p> <p><b>Intro</b></p> <p><br/>The paper explains how you can write an interpreter and get an optimizing just-in-time (JIT) compiler for free. This enables language designers to focus on features without worrying about the complexities of compiler optimizations and code generation. This paper presents a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that allows the application to control the JIT compiler behavior at runtime. We'll discuss how various programming languages can take advantage of this framework.</p> <p>To intrigue compiler aficionados, the authors show how combining AST node rewriting during interpretation, optimization, and deoptimization produces high performance code from the interpreter without a language-specific compiler. In addition, they present how features of a variety of programming languages, such as JavaScript, Ruby, Python, R and others, map on the framework.</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/6/c/8/600_354266312.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p><br/>Aysylu Greenberg has many hobbies. By day, she works on search infrastructure at Google. For fun, she writes open-source libraries in Clojure, ponders the design of systems that deal with inaccuracies, paints and sculpts. Her curiosity for everything new and unexplored drives her to seek out cutting edge research papers. You can find <a href="https://twitter.com/aysylu22">@aysylu22</a> on <a href="https://github.com/aysylu">github.com/aysylu</a> and <a href="http://aysy.lu" class="linkified">http://aysy.lu</a>.</p> <p><b>Details</b></p> <p>Doors open at 7 pm; the presentation will begin at 7:30 pm; and, yes, there will be beer and pizza. </p> <p>After Aysylu presents the paper, we will open up the floor to discussion and questions.  </p> <p>We hope that you'll read the paper before the meetup, but don't stress if you never get around to it, and if you have any questions, thoughts, or related information, please visit our *<a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/102">github-thread</a>* on the matter.</p> <p>Additionally, if you have any papers you want to add to the repository above, please send us a <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/pulls">pull request</a>.

    description: '<p>We''re happy to have <a href="https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/model-analysis/">Erik
      Hinton</a>, developer at the New York Times, presenting on <a href="http://strictlypositive.org/diff.pdf">The
      Derivative of a Regular Type is its Type of One-Hole Contexts</a> by Conor McBride.</p>
      <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p> <p>Papers are generally loved for one of two reasons.
      Either the paper is foundational, siring a lineage of important research, or
      the paper is useful, guiding readers toward clever optimizations, fault-tolerant
      solutions, and non-intuitive hacks. "The Derivative of a Regular Type is its
      Type of One-Hole Contexts" is neither. Only a few papers build on McBride''s
      work and the conclusions of the paper, though promising, haven''t yet found
      any real employ.</p> <p>This paper is lovable, fun, and important because it
      is a radical thought experiment in the limits of abstraction. The paper poses
      the question: we call data types "algebraic", so can we "do calculus" on them?
      Surely, the nomenclature is just coincidental? What would it even mean to take
      the derivative of a data type? The paper stretches algebraic data types to what
      should be their breaking point and then demonstrates that it''s not a breaking
      point ay all. By considering the paper''s set-up and implications, we gain a
      deeper understanding of types and what they abstract. </p> <p>As it will turn
      out, you can take the derivative of data type and the result is meaningful.
      The derivative of an algebraic type is another data type, namely the type that
      can represent any specific context in the original type, any position in the
      original structure. This relationship is eerily similar to the relationship
      of functions to their derivatives (roughly, the contextual rate of change) that
      we all learned in high school. </p> <p>• No previous knowledge of calculus,
      algebraic data types, zippers, contexts or anything else is required.</p> <p>This
      talk will cover:</p> <p>- What is an algebraic data type? </p> <p>- What is
      a zipper and its sister structure, the one-hole context?</p> <p>- How can we
      derive a one-hole context from any given type? (How can we represent a specific
      location in an arbitrarily complex tree, type, etc)</p> <p>- What are the one-hole
      contexts of common types: the list, the binary tree, the ternary tree, and the
      rose tree?</p> <p>- Why would anyone care?</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Erik Hinton
      (<a href="https://twitter.com/erikhinton">@erikhinton</a>) is an interactive
      developer for The New York Times. His interests include building a platform
      for the digital humanities, subversively deploying Haskell applications when
      no one is watching, analytic philosophy, and the connections between medieval
      mystical Judaism and all of the above.</p> <p><b>Details</b></p> <p>Doors open
      at 7 pm; the presentation will begin at 7:30 pm; and, yes, there will be beer
      and pizza. </p> <p>After Erik presents the paper, we will open up the floor
      to discussion and questions.  </p> <p>We hope that you''ll read the paper before
      the meetup, but don''t stress if you can''t.  If you have any questions, thoughts,
      or related information, please visit our *<a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/118">github-thread</a>*

      exemplifies this.  It was first stated in <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=800125.804056">1973</a>,
      and can be described to anyone in two sentences, or with one sentence and a
      picture.  But it took 11 years before an optimal solution was discovered, and
      another 16 before an understandable and implementable solution with the same
      bounds was presented, in this paper, <i>The LCA Problem Revisited</i>.  This
      problem is furthermore satisfying because its bounds are so tight: pre-processing
      takes as long as just reading the input, and queries are constant time.</p>
      <p><i>The LCA Problem Revisited</i> is a wonderfully curated journey through
      a deceptively simple problem that comes together in the end in a beautiful way,
      and it uses techniques that are powerful in plenty of other places.  Plus, it
      solves another bonus problem along the way!</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Leif Walsh

    description: '<p>We''re excited to have Peter Burka , member of the software research
      team at <a href="http://www.twosigma.com/">Two Sigma</a>, presenting on <i><a
      href="http://dig.cs.illinois.edu/papers/lambdaRefactoring.pdf">Crossing the
      Gap from Imperative to Functional Programming through Refactoring</a></i> by
      Alex Gyori, Lyle Franklin, Danny Dig, and Jan Lahoda.</p> <p><b>Intro</b></p>
      <p>The introduction of lambdas to Java 8 might be the most significant change
      to the Java language since Java 2 was released in 1998. Lambdas and the accompanying
      functional operations like map and filter promise to allow Java programmers
      to write clearer, simpler code, and to take better advantage of parallelism.</p>
      <p>While developers of new code will be able to start using the features immediately,
      what should we do with the billions of lines of code that have already been
      written? This paper proposes that we can automatically translate the existing
      body of Java code to make use of the new features.  This improves the readability
      of the old code, maintains consistency between new and old code, and potentially
      improves performance.</p> <p>This paper addresses technical debt, an area of
      software engineering which is only starting to be addressed in academic literature.
      The authors solve a practical and important problem with a powerful technical
      tool.</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Peter Burka (<a href="https://twitter.com/pburka">@pburka</a>)
      is a member of the software research lab at Two Sigma Investments. He’s interested
      in many areas of software development, and has recently been dividing his time
      between exploring programming for many-core devices and finding ways to address
      technical debt through automation. Previously, he helped develop IBM’s J9 Java
      virtual machine, where he built the balanced garbage collector and ported the
      JVM to Palm Pilot, among other achievements. Peter has a great fondness for
      Smalltalk and is pleased that, 35 years on, its influence can still be seen
      in so many languages and systems.</p> <p><b>Paper Abstract</b></p> <p>Java 8
      introduces two functional features: lambda expressions and functional operations
      like map or filter that apply a lambda expression over the elements of a Collection.
      Refactoring existing code to use these new features enables explicit but unobtrusive
      parallelism and makes the code more succinct. However, refactoring is tedious:
      it requires changing many lines of code. It is also error-prone: the programmer
      must reason about the control-, data-flow, and side-effects. Fortunately, refactorings
      can be automated. We designed and implemented LambdaFicator, a tool which automates
      two refactorings. The first refactoring converts anonymous inner classes to
      lambda expressions. The second refactoring converts for loops that iterate over
      Collections to functional operations that use lambda expressions. Using 9 open-source
      projects, we have applied these two refactorings 1263 and 1709 times, respectively.
      The results show that LambdaFicator is useful: (i) it is widely applicable,
      (ii) it reduces the code bloat, (iii) it increases programmer productivity,
      and (iv) it is accurate.</p> <p><br/><b>Details</b></p> <p>Doors open at 7 pm;
      the presentation will begin at 7:30 pm; and, yes, there will be beer, water,

      the Runway</a>, presenting on <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/archive/chubby-osdi06.pdf">The
      Chubby lock service for loosely-coupled distributed systems</a> by Mike Burrows.</p>
      <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p> <p>Distributed consensus is often discussed in terms
      of algorithms: Paxos, ZAB, RAFT, etc. But while the algorithms may be more or
      less mind-bending, for me the more interesting aspect of distributed consensus
      is creating systems that support it for the general use case. This paper, on
      Google''s Chubby lock service, is the story of happens when a system stops being
      a polite theory, and starts getting real-world use. </p> <p>To anyone who has
      worked in depth as a distributed systems engineer, Chubby is a beautiful paper.
      It is not a paper about algorithms and their limits, or a toy fringe system
      created by grad students to test a hypothesis. It is a paper that describes
      the real tradeoffs that real systems engineers make when designing something
      to solve a large set of problems well enough. This paper shows the key insights
      that the authors had as to how such a system might be used, and awareness of
      what it should do well, and what it should not try to do well. It details how
      Chubby was designed, but then goes further to describe how it ended up being
      used when released to the wild, and the surprises and consequences of these
      design decisions.</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Camille Fournier (<a href="https://twitter.com/skamille">@skamille</a>)

    description: <p>We're thrilled to have <a href="http://jeanyang.com/">Jean Yang</a>, PhD student at MIT, presenting on <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Hoare69.pdf">An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming</a> by C.A.R. Hoare. </p> <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p> <p>Our lives now run on software. Bugs are becoming not just annoyances for software developers, but sources of potentially catastrophic failures. A careless programmer mistake could leak our social security numbers or crash our cars. While testing provides some assurance, it is difficult to test all possibilities in complex systems--and practically impossible in concurrent systems. For the critical systems in our lives, we should demand mathematical guarantees that the software behaves the way the programmer expected.</p> <p><br/>A single paper influenced much of the work towards providing these mathematical guarantees. C.A.R. Hoare’s seminal 1969 paper “An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming” introduces a method of reasoning about program correctness now known as Hoare logic. In this paper, Hoare provides a technique that 1) allows programmers to express program properties and 2) allows these properties to be automatically checked. These ideas have influenced decades of research in automated reasoning about software correctness.</p> <p><br/>In this talk, I will describe the main ideas in Hoare logic, as well as the impact of these ideas. I will talk about my personal experience using Hoare logic to verify memory guarantees in an operating system. I will also discuss takeaway lessons for working programmers.</p> <p><br/><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Jean Yang (<a href="https://twitter.com/jeanqasaur">@jeanqasaur</a>) is a final-year PhD student at MIT. For her PhD thesis she has created <a href="http://projects.csail.mit.edu/jeeves/">Jeeves</a>, a programming language for automatically enforcing information flow policies for security and privacy. You may be more familiar with one of her other projects, <a href="http://haskellryangosling.tumblr.com/">Haskell Ryan Gosling</a>.</p> <p><br/><b>Details</b></p> <p>This event is sponsored by <a href="https://www.theladders.com/">The Ladders</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/theladdersdev">@TheLaddersDev</a>)</p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/9/8/600_431498296.jpeg" /></p> <p>Doors open at 7 pm; the presentation will begin at 7:30 pm; and, yes, there will be beer, water, and pizza. </p> <p>After Jean presents the paper, we will open up the floor to discussion and questions.  </p> <p>We hope that you'll read the paper before the meetup, but don't stress if you can't.  If you have any questions, thoughts, or related information, please visit our *<a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/199">github-thread</a>* on the matter.</p> <p>Additionally, if you have any papers you want to add to the repository above (papers that you love!), please send us a <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/pulls">pull request</a>.

    description: '<p>We''re thrilled to have Jeff Larson, data editor Data Editor
      at ProPublica, presenting <a href="http://gatekeeper.dec.com/ftp/pub/dec/SRC/publications/broder/positano-final-wpnums.pdf">On
      the resemblance and containment of documents</a> by Andrei Z. Broder.</p> <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p>
      <p>Increasingly Journalists are dealing with ever larger document dumps, and
      in order to find interesting stories in these troves, they have to cluster the
      documents to separate the wheat from the chaff. The size of these dumps often
      means that traditional algorithms either are too complex and take too long,
      or they rely on apriori constants like the number of clusters to search for.</p>
      <p>Jeff Larson will present a novel algorithm called minhashing that was invented
      at AltaVista in order to loosely cluster similar documents. The paper " On the
      resemblance and containment of documents" relies on a hash collisions to create
      document fingerprints and shows that documents can be clustered in linear time
      without knowledge of the entire document corpus. This algorithm has been a key
      tool in some of ProPublica''s biggest investigations, and has allowed reporters
      to shine light on topics such as political astroturfing and international money
      laundering.</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Jeff Larson (<a href="https://twitter.com/thejefflarson">@thejefflarson</a>)
      is ProPublica''s data editor and winner of the 2011 Livingston Award for the
      series "<a href="http://www.propublica.org/series/redistricting">Redistricting:
      how Powerful Interests are Drawing You Out of a Vote</a>." He was on the team
      reporting on the Snowden files in 2013 with the Guardian and the New York times,
      and was the lead reporter behind the NSA stories "<a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/the-nsas-secret-campaign-to-crack-undermine-internet-encryption">The
      NSA’s Secret Campaign to Crack, Undermine Internet Security</a>" and "<a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/spy-agencies-probe-angry-birds-and-other-apps-for-personal-data">Spy
      Agencies Probe Angry Birds and Other Apps for Personal Data</a>."</p> <p><b>Details</b></p>
      <p>Doors open at 7 pm; the presentation will begin at 7:30 pm; and, yes, there
      will be beer, water, and pizza. </p> <p>After Jeff presents the paper, we will
      open up the floor to discussion and questions.  </p> <p>We hope that you''ll
      read the paper before the meetup, but don''t stress if you can''t.  If you have
      any questions, thoughts, or related information, please visit our *<a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/197">github-thread</a>*

      <p>We're extremely thrilled to host Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, Assistant Professor in the School of Informatics and Computing at Indiana University, presenting <b><a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/macromod.pdf">Composable and Compilable Macros</a> </b>by <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/">Matthew Flatt</a> of the University of Utah.<i></i></p> <p>













      <b>Intro</b></p> <p>


















      "<i>Composable and Compilable Macros</i>" introduces the Racket module system, which addresses the following problem: When you have macros that run programs at compile-time, how does this interact with separate compilation and ahead-of-time compilation. The paper introduces "phases", which enable Racket to behave the same regardless of when and how you compile your program. It also introduces the idea of writing different modules in different languages, which is now used for systems like Typed Racket.</p> <p>A few related papers:</p> <p>- <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/pubs/LaSC-5-4-pp295-326.pdf">Syntactic Abstraction in Scheme</a>, Dybvig Hieb &amp; Bruggeman, Lisp andSymbolic Computation 1993</p> <p>- <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/jfp12-draft-fcdf.pdf">Macros that Work Together</a>, Flatt, Findler, Culpepper, &amp; Darais, JFP 2012- Submodules in Racket, Flatt GPCE 2013</p> <p>- <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/pubs/implicit-phasing.pdf">Implicit phasing for R6RS libraries</a>,  Ghuloum &amp; Dybvig, ICFP 2007</p> <p>- <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/pubs/popl99.pdf">Extending the scope of syntactic abstraction</a>, Waddell &amp; Dybvig, POPL 1999</p> <p>














      <b>Bio</b></p> <p>













      <a href="http://samth.github.io/">Sam Tobin-Hochstadt</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/samth">@samth</a>) is an Assistant Professor in the School of Informatics and Computing at Indiana University. He has worked on dynamic languages, type systems, module systems, and metaprogramming, including creating the Typed Racket system and popularizing the phrase “scripts to programs.” He is a member of the ECMA TC39 working group responsible for standardizing JavaScript, where he co-designed the module system for ES6, the next version of JavaScript. He received his PhD in 2010 from Northeastern University under Matthias Felleisen.</p> <p>

      <p>We're riveted to have Andrew Turley, lead software engineer on the platform team at<a href="https://www.theladders.com/">TheLadders</a>, presenting<a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/garbage_collection/incremental_mature_garbage_collection_using_the_train_algorithm.pdf?raw=true">Incremental Mature Garbage Collection Using the Train Algorithm</a> by Jacob Seligmann &amp; Steffen Grarup.  </p> <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p> <p><br/>Automatic garbage collection has spared programmers from an entire class of programming errors related to memory leaks and attempting to access objects that were incorrectly freed. As programs have grown in size and complexity, so have the systems that manage garbage collection. Each algorithm makes a different set of tradeoffs between factors such as the space used by objects, the space used by bookkeeping, the number of unused objects (garbage) that remain uncollected, the time spent in allocation, and the time spent in<br/>collection.</p> <p>The Train Algorithm is an incremental generational garbage collector that was designed to deal with the long and unpredictable pause times caused by other algorithms. It does this by grouping objects together on "cars" in "trains". The algorithm provides a strategy for moving objects from the younger generation into different cars, moving objects from one car to another, and collecting cars and trains. It was first described by Hudson and Moss in the paper "Incremental<br/>Collection of Mature Objects".</p> <p>In their paper "<a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/garbage_collection/incremental_mature_garbage_collection_using_the_train_algorithm.pdf?raw=true">Incremental Mature Garbage Collection Using the Train Algorithm</a>," Seligmann and Grarup describe what they believe is the first implementation of the Train Algorithm, which they used to replace the traditional mark-and-sweep collector that was used in the BETA programming language. They discuss their implementation and present information about the performance characteristics of the new algorithm as compared to the original.</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Andrew Turley (<a href="https://twitter.com/casio_juarez">@casio_juarez</a>) is a lead software engineer on the platform team at <a href="https://www.theladders.com/">TheLadders</a>, where he builds infrastructure by linking Storm topologies together using RabbitMQ. He has also had numerous professional brushes with lower levels of the software stack, including building embedded systems for processing audio at DigiDesign, and helping to improve the performance of iOS at<br/>Apple.</p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/5/4/a/600_433302314.jpeg" /></p> <p><i><b><a href="https://www.twosigma.com/">TwoSigma</a> </b>- Platinum Sponsor of the New York chapter</i></p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p><b>Details</b></p> <p>Doors open at 7 pm; the presentation will begin at 7:30 pm; and, yes, there will be refreshments of all kinds and pizza. </p> <p><br/>After Andrew presents the paper, we will open up the floor to discussion and questions.  </p> <p><br/>We hope that you'll read the paper before the meetup, but don't stress if you can't.  If you have any questions, thoughts, or related information, please visit our *<a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/258">github-thread</a>* on the matter.</p> <p>Additionally, if you have any papers you want to add to the repository above (papers that you love!), please send us a <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/pulls">pull request</a>.

    <p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.</p>
    <p>We're curating a <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">repository</a> for papers and places-to-find papers. You can contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories.</p>
    <p><span>We're posting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PapersWeLove">videos</a> of all our presentations, from all our chapters. </span><br>

Do you like the way that JavaScript and Ruby allow you to add behaviors to existing objects? Would you like to do that and still have the type safety of Java or C#?</p> <p>Michael Perry will present the paper and lead a discussion. Please read the paper ahead of time, so we can all benefit from your viewpoint.</p> <p>To read an academic paper:</p> <p>• Read the abstract</p> <p>• Read the conclusion</p> <p>• Scan the outline</p> <p>• Skim the article, skipping equations and proofs</p> <p>• Dive in to the parts that interest you most</p> <p>It helps to write out the outline on a separate page, and then summarize the sections as you skim them.</p>

How do they get the light from its environment to reflect off its surface? And how do they make it cast a shadow on nearby objects in the shot?</p> <p>In many ways, an image that is purely artificial is easier to generate. But when the real world and the digital world collide, magic happens. We can put fantasy within the context of everyday life. But this is not easy. Let's explore some of the techniques for making this happen.</p> <p>Adam Hill has attended several SIGGRAPH conventions in the past. He applies his knowledge and passion for digital imagery to business app and game development alike. He will guide us on this fascinating journey.</p>

Stephen Wolfram has invented "A New Kind of Science" to study these machines, and determine how we can use them to understand the natural world.</p> <p><br/>Nik Clarkson will guide us through one of Wolfram's early papers on the subject. He takes a fresh approach to the problem, in which he first tries to achieve the same results as nature, and then tries to walk back to an understanding of the governing laws.</p>

    <p>Share in the love of mathematics with like-minded explorers. Does Gödel give you chills? Does Cantor raise your hackles? Are you Team Turing or Team Church? Each month we will select a paper to review and discuss. One member will lead the discussion, but all participants are expected to share their impressions, findings, and questions. Papers will focus on the application of software to mathematics. Some topics we will cover include Computability, Information Theory, Cryptography, and Distributed Computing. Share your code. Share your thoughts. Share your knowledge. But most importantly, share the love of math with your peers. We meet on the first Monday of the month at Improving Enterprises in Addison, TX. Pizza and networking start at 6:30, followed by discussions at 7:00. If the meeting goes past 9:00, we'll reconvene at a local bar or restaurant.</p>
    <p>We encourage participation from all members of our community. We work hard to make this a safe and friendly environment. Please honor our <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>. Thank you.</p>

      <p>Sam L'ecuyer will present <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/fournet/papers/join-tutorial.pdf">The Join Calculus: a Language for Distributed Mobile Programming</a>, by Cedric Fournet and Georges Gonthier.</p> <p>

      --</p> <p>Do semaphores and mutexes, distributed locks and clocks confound you? Does concurrency as an afterthought frustrate and bewilder you? In this paper, Fournet and Gonthier present the join calculus, a modeling language for clean, asynchronous distributed computing. This language builds upon well established techniques of pattern matching, static typing, and local variable declaration to lay the foundation for synchronizing data across multiple machines, code mobility, and failure detection.</p> <p>--</p> <p>Sam L'ecuyer (<a href="https://twitter.com/cateches">@cateches</a>) is a front-end engineer at Yahoo.  You can find a lot of the code he writes at <a href="https://screen.yahoo.com">screen.yahoo.com</a>. He enjoys static typing, text editors from the 1970s, and making his own cocktail bitters.</p>

      <p>In 2004 DHH <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/107370">announced</a> the initial release for Rails. This year <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/98cb3e69afd687f7c0d4bc48eabf284da691abcc#commitcomment[masked]">marks ten years</a> since its release.</p> <p>Let's celebrate this occasion by holding a launch party on 26th April 2014.</p> <p>Rails 4.1 will be out at Railsconf this year. Considering that there have been major changes from 3x onwards to 4.0 - 4.1, we plan to do a small workshop, focusing on new features with 4.1.</p> <p>The workshop will focus on new things like:</p> <p>• Reviewing ActiveRecord concepts.</p> <p>• Mailer Preview</p> <p>• Message Verifier</p> <p>• JSON Encoder changes</p> <p>• Security changes like secrets.yml</p> <p>• Spring/Binstubs etc</p> <p>


      Ruby 2.1.1 also turns a page with exciting new features. We'll try to go briefly over some of them.</p> <p>Come join us for the workshop and Rails 4.1 Launch party, celebrating 10 years of Rails!</p> <p>UPDATE: There will be Lunch and Cake, sponsored by <a href="http://bigbinary.com">BigBinary</a> and <a href="http://revealinghour.in">Revealing Hour Creations</a>. Thanks to these amazing folks!</p>

      <p>Hi everyone,<br/>Let's meet and talk about Consensus Algorithm Papers:</p> <p>In Search Of An Understandable Consensus Algorithm: <a href="https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/raft.pdf" class="linkified">https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/raft.pdf</a></p> <p>The Part-Time Parliament: <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf" class="linkified">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf</a></p> <p>Paxos Made Simple: <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/papers/paxos-simple.pdf" class="linkified">http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/papers/paxos-simple.pdf</a></p> <p><b>Who organises it?</b></p> <p>It's community-organised. If you'd like to co-organise, moderate or can help in any other way, ping &lt;a&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;, he'll add you to admins.</p> <p><b>How does it work? </b></p> <p>We all read papers offline, then we meet together and start up a discussion, hacking, trying things out, bringing up examples from industry and learn more about what we've read.</p> <p>We've got four lightning talks to heat up the discussion:</p> <p>- Sorting algorithms based on 0-1 lemma (Stefan Schwetschke)</p> <p>- RANSAC (random sample consensus) algorithm with a few examples (Kai Wolf)</p> <p>- Software systems that use Paxos or Raft (Daniel Mitterdorfer)</p> <p>- An overview how etcd uses the raft protocol (Christine Koppelt)</p> <p>


      <b>Why should I participate?</b></p> <p>Because papers are fun! It's actually quite easy to read papers, and we'd like to have more people who know about modern Computer Science and Math trends. That would significantly improve your knowledge and marketability.</p> <p>There are many more papers to read and discuss. You can check some of them on <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <p>The next Meetup will be about probabilistic data structures, what they are and what they are used for. It is thought more as an overview of the different data structures than of sophisticated use cases.</p> <p>

      The following article provides a good overview about the topic: [1]</p> <p>

      Wikipedia is also a good starting point [2]</p> <p>

      Some (definitely not all) interesting papers are:</p> <p>

      • Bloom filter: Space/Time Trade-offs in Hash Coding with Allowable Errors [3]</p> <p>

      • Skip list: Skip Lists: A Probabilistic Alternative to Balanced Trees [4] </p> <p>

      • Count–min sketch: An Improved Data Stream Summary: The Count-Min Sketch and its Applications [5]</p> <p>

      • Hidden Markov Models: [6], [7], [8]</p> <p>


      Agenda:</p> <p>

      19:00 - 19:30 Socializing</p> <p>

      19:30 - 20:30 Talks</p> <p>

      Bloom Filters - Stefan Seelmann</p> <p>

      Count-Min Sketch - Alex Petrov</p> <p>

      Hidden Markov Models - Juan Miguel Cejula</p> <p>


      20:30 - 20:45 Break</p> <p>

      20:45 - 21:30 Discussion</p> <p>

      For the rest of the evening, starting to create something would be nice (for those who don't get enough). Some ideas:</p> <p>

      • Implementing one or multiple data structures in a language of choice</p> <p>

      • Creating browser based animations how some of the data structures work</p> <p>

      • Evaluating existing implementations</p> <p>

      • Outline for a (non-scientific) magazine article or conference talk</p> <p>

  description: <p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss. Papers We Love Munich has a <a href="https://github.com/papers-lovers-munich/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

    description: <p>Thanks for your interest in Papers We Love Columbus! </p> <p>For the first meeting we expect to spend some time getting logistical kinks worked out, so rather than trying to recruit a legendary speaker to present a difficult paper, we are making the meeting pretty informal. </p> <p>This is a chance to meet people in Columbus interested in computer science research and to begin to plan the future of the group. Please bring along a copy of a paper you've enjoyed to give away, and you can leave with a copy of someone else's favorite!</p> <p>I'll try to organize food if enough people RSVP. </p>

    description: '<p>Do a web search for "Out of the Tar Pit," and you''ll find 1)
      <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/design/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf?raw=true">the
      paper itself</a> and 2) a long list of "top 10 papers every programmer should
      read" type blog posts citing it. The premise of the paper is certainly ambitious:
      Explain why developing and maintaining large software systems is hard, and how
      to fix it. </p> <p>Amazingly, this 10 year old paper mostly delivers. Perhaps
      even more surprisingly, however, its clear explanation, high citation count,
      and relatively straightforward prescription for dealing with complexity have
      not translated into a correspondingly large influence on mainstream programming
      tools and frameworks (with certain notable exceptions, such as the Clojure community). </p>
      <p>In a sense, then, reading the paper informs us not only of the authors''
      strategy for building large, maintainable systems, but of our own community''s
      ability to digest useful but wide-reaching suggestions for change. We are sure
      to have a lively discussion! </p> <p>It''s not necessary to read the entire
      paper to attend the meetup, but it is a great and accessible paper and you''ll
      probably enjoy it if you do. The presentation should be accessible to and useful
      people who have read the entire paper multiple times and people who have just
      skimmed the abstract. </p> <p>This meeting is sponsored by Improving Enterprises,
      who will provide food and drinks. </p> <p>About the presenter: Mykola Bilokonsky
      is a consulting developer working in Columbus. This is his first talk and he''s
      eager to exchange thoughts!</p>'

      <p>Online tax preparation or financial advice sounds like a viable business, but "secure" sites are broken every day. Consumers are rightly wary of disclosing their personal information to cloud-based service providers. How can you build a service which delivers real value and is backed by a hard, cryptographic guarantee of security?</p> <p>

      What if it were possible for a customer to give their data to a cloud provider in encrypted form, and for that provider to perform useful computations on that data without ever decrypting it? The results would be delivered to the customer, encrypted with a key that only they knew. It sounds like an ideal solution, but maybe impossible?</p> <p>

      This is the promise of homomorphic encryption. The idea has been around for some time, but it was considered intriguing but maybe not possible until Craig Gentry's groundbreaking thesis. Gentry later published a much more accessible paper called "Computing Arbitrary Functions of Encrypted Data".</p> <p>

      <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/easy-fhe.pdf" class="linkified">https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/easy-fhe.pdf</a></p> <p>

      Research on homomorphic encryption is fast-moving, and the state of the art is improving every year. The presenter's opinion is that homomorphic encryption will change cloud computing in a way similar to how SSL/TLS changed online commerce. It is the future of online privacy.</p> <p>This event is presented in cooperation with Franklin University's Computer Science program. They'd appreciate an RSVP at <a href="http://whoozin.com/7G7-WRQ-YPP6"><a href="http://whoozin.com/7G7-WRQ-YPP6" class="linkified">http://whoozin.com/7G7-WRQ-YPP6</a></a> for space planning purposes.</p> <p>About the presenter: </p> <p>Craig Stuntz is a software engineer and a lifelong student of computer science, with specific interests in programming languages, type theory, compilers, and math. He lives in Columbus, Ohio, works for Improving Enterprises as Principal Consultant II, and cofounded the Columbus branch of Papers We Love, a reading group for people interested in academic computer science research.</p> <p>When not at work or playing with his kids, he is usually studying math or playing Irish traditional music on the tin whistle and wooden flute.</p>

      <p>I'm going to talk about shape grammars (split grammars, place grammars), in particular their application to procedural 3D content generation as presented in the paper "Procedural Modeling of Buildings" by Müller, Wonka, et al.  This was a landmark paper (along with the 2003 "Instant Architecture") that is still the state of the art in some ways.  There might be some digression into general grammar-driven generation, especially for automatic test generation, since it's a broad and interesting topic.</p> <p>



      The primary paper I'll be discussing is available at</p> <p><a href="http://peterwonka.net/Publications/pdfs/2006.SG.Mueller.ProceduralModelingOfBuildings.final.pdf">  <a href="http://peterwonka.net/Publications/pdfs/2006.SG.Mueller.ProceduralModelingOfBuildings.final.pdf" class="linkified">http://peterwonka.net/Publications/pdfs/2006.SG.Mueller.ProceduralModelingOfBuildings.final.pdf</a></a></p> <p>The author's site,</p> <p>  <a href="http://peterwonka.net/Publications/publications.html"><a href="http://peterwonka.net/Publications/publications.html" class="linkified">http://peterwonka.net/Publications/publications.html</a></a></p> <p>is a great resource for papers related specifically to building and facade modelling, including a paper, "On-the-fly Generation and Rendering of Infinite Cities on the GPU", which refers to the paper Peter Zion presented last month on dynamic GPU memory allocation.  Of special interest, too, is Inverse Procedural Modeling, on which much work has been done in the last few years and which builds upon the use of shape grammars.</p> <p><br/>I also considered presenting Stiny's original paper, which is available along with a bibliography of more general shape grammar papers (some of which I'll be mentioning) at</p> <p>  <a href="http://shapegrammar.org/"><a href="http://shapegrammar.org/" class="linkified">http://shapegrammar.org/</a></a></p> <p>



      Finally, for some motivating examples, here is a 64k demo (i.e., the program which produces this output is only 64 kilobytes, and does it in realtime!) that has some characteristic shape grammar effects:</p> <p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZdlSWLqumw"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZdlSWLqumw" class="embedded">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZdlSWLqumw</a></a></p> <p>And here are some examples from someone's work-in-progress game involving procedurally-generated sprawl:</p> <p>  <a href="http://delacian.tumblr.com/"><a href="http://delacian.tumblr.com/" class="linkified">http://delacian.tumblr.com/</a></a></p>

      <p>Guy Dumais will present <a href="http://www.xuanhui.me/pub/wsdm427-kang.pdf">"Learning to Rank with Multi-Aspect Relevance for Vertical Search" by Kang et al.</a>, which presents machine learning approaches to ranking the results of a query based on an aggregate of metrics whose combined weight is not well-defined.</p> <p>



      While the relevance of this to people involved in machine learning or targeted search is clear, I would imagine there will be interesting discussion for anyone who has to deal with problems where heuristics are hard to come up with ahead of time.</p> <p>

      Radialpoint have kindly offered to host the meetup this time.</p>

      <p>Pablo Duboue will present "<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/zero.pdf">Structural Zeros versus Sampling Zeros</a>" by Mohri and Roark; this looks like a fascinating paper with applicability to improving all kinds of probabilistic models.  He will also be talking about the specific application of this idea to probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) parsing as discussed in another Mohri and Roark paper, "<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/spcfg.pdf">Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar Induction Based on Structural Zeros</a>".  Anyone interested in machine learning, natural language processing, parsing in general, even automated test generation and model checking, or all kinds of other topics should definitely attend!</p> <p>



      I apologize for the delay in announcing this meetup.  I was in Toronto checking out their PWL chapter to hopefully borrow some ideas (and speakers!) and lost track of time.</p> <p>


      Note that since Radialpoint have kindly offered to host again, and their building closes early, we're going to try to start this meetup at 6:30, by which I mean you should come sometime around 6:00 to enjoy a libation and conversation before the talk starts at 6:30.  (Times subject to change, of course; be sure to check the meetup page on the day of the event.)</p>

    <p>This is the Montreal chapter of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love">http://www.paperswelove.org/.</a></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>We meet monthly to discuss a paper or papers someone loves, to help bridge the gap between industry and academia for working programmers.  Anyone, of any skill level or area of specialization, is welcome to attend.<br>

    </p>
    <p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">code of conduct</a>; also, we try to follow <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules">the Hacker School Social Rules</a> because we feel they fix certain common social bugs in technical meetups.<br>

    </p>
    Les séances sont en anglais pour la plupart, mais des séances, interlocutions, questions en français sont bienvenue.<br>

    description: '<p>Our inaugural meetup will feature <a href="http://caitiem.com">Caitie McCaffrey</a>,
      a Software Engineer at HBO, presenting on <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/210931/Orleans-MSR-TR-2014-41.pdf">Orleans:
      Distributed Virtual Actors for Programmability and Scalability</a> by Bernstein,
      Bykov, Geller, Kliot &amp; Thelin from Microsoft Research.</p> <p><b>Intro:</b></p>
      <p>Orleans is a  runtime and programming model for building scalable distributed
      systems, based on the actor model.  The Orleans programming model introduces
      the abstraction of Virtual Actors.  Orleans allows applications to obtain high
      performance, reliability, and scalability.  This technology was developed by
      the eXtreme Computing Group at Microsoft Research and was a core component of
      the Azure Services that supported that powered Halo 4, the award winning video
      game.  </p> <p><b>About Caitie:</b></p> <p>Caitie McCaffrey is a Backend Brat,
      Distributed Systems Diva, and Tech Lover. She is currently a Software Engineer
      at HBO, and prior to that worked at 343 Industries. Her focus is on Web Services,
      Distributed Systems, and Big Data. She is passionate about creating fun, social,
      and collaborative entertainment experiences. Caitie has a degree in Computer
      Science from Cornell University, and has worked on several video games including
      Gears of War 2, Gears of War 3, and most recently Halo 4. She currently is working
      at HBO on the HBO Go services. She maintains a blog at CaitieM.com and frequently
      discusses technology and entertainment on Twitter @CaitieM20</p> <p><br/><b>About
      Papers We Love:</b></p> <p>First of all, Papers We Love follows this <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code
      of Conduct</a>, with the change that Michael Bernstein @mrb_bk, [masked] is
      the point of contact. Michael spoke at and helped organize the meetup in NYC,
      and is excited to bring it to the DC area.</p> <p>Second of all, <b>try to read
      the paper, but don''t stress if you can''t</b>. PWL is an inclusive, beginner-friendly
      environment meant to foster learning and growth.</p> <p>Third of all, <b>we''re
      looking for a venue</b>! We have some leads but get in touch if you have any
      ideas for venues in DC proper. </p> <p>Finally, <b>we would love some sponsorship</b> for
      food and drink at the meetup. I''ll probably just pony up myself for the first
      meetup if we can''t find someone, but also would love help <b>video recording</b>
      for documentation purposes.</p>'

    <p>The Washington, DC Metro Area chapter of "<a href="http://meetup.com/papers-we-love/">Papers We Love</a>" - the following description comes from the NYC Chapter's website:</p>
    <p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.</p>
    <p>We're curating a <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">repository</a> for papers and places-to-find papers. You can contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories.</p>
    <p>We're posting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PapersWeLove">videos</a> of all our presentations, from all our chapters. </p>
    <p>If you need to reach out to us or have ideas for papers, just ask us via our <a href="https://twitter.com/papers_we_love">twitter account</a>.</p>
    <p>Papers We Love has a <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>. Please contact one of the Meetup's organizers if anyone is not following it. Be good to each other and to the PWL community!</p>
