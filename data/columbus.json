Consumers are rightly wary of disclosing their personal information to cloud-based service providers. How can you build a service which delivers real value and is backed by a hard, cryptographic guarantee of security?</p> <p>\n\nWhat if it were possible for a customer to give their data to a cloud provider in encrypted form, and for that provider to perform useful computations on that data without ever decrypting it? The results would be delivered to the customer, encrypted with a key that only they knew. It sounds like an ideal solution, but maybe impossible?</p> <p>\n\nThis is the promise of homomorphic encryption. The idea has been around for some time, but it was considered intriguing but maybe not possible until Craig Gentry's groundbreaking thesis. Gentry later published a much more accessible paper called \"Computing Arbitrary Functions of Encrypted Data\".</p> <p>\n\n<a href=\"https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/easy-fhe.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/easy-fhe.pdf</a></p> <p>\n\nResearch on homomorphic encryption is fast-moving, and the state of the art is improving every year.
